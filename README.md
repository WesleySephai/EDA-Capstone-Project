# Capstone-Project

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, you would explore the Data preprocessing techniques learned. You will use, pandas, plots and the different data preprocessing techniques to explore and analyse the data. This project is on Exploratory Data Analysis

## Machine Learning
In this project, we develop a machine learning model to detect diabetes. Perform data cleaning and transformation. Handle null 
values, outliers, convert categorical features to numerical values. Select and apply an appropriate machine learning model. Evaluate the model and fine-tune if necessary.
